***************************
* Compiling the program   *
***************************
The program has been able to be compiled under g++ 2.7.0 and g++ 2.6.3. If
your computer uses BSD operating system, just type "make", and an executable
file "dopart" will be generated. If you are using SYSV instead, you need to
comment out a line in "makefile" to compile (look inside the file please).

***************************
* Usage of the program    *
***************************
The program accepts 4 arguments:
 (1) hypergraph file name (2) output file name (3) random seed  (4) cut-ratio
 cut-ratio is the minimum percent of cells on one partition. Consecutive run
 of the program will append the results to the output file.

For example, the following command will partition p1.net using random seed 1,
and append output result to file "level". The balance condition is 45% - 55%.

 ./dohpart p1.net level 1 0.45

The output result of this command look like:

p1.net,seed, 1,final cutset, 83,time, 0.22 ,376,457,passes 8

That is: hypergraph file name, random seed, cutset, time in seconds, # of cells
in each partition, # of passes.

****************************
* Interpreting the results *
****************************

We have also supplied a C program stats.c which may be compiled
with cc or any C compiler.  stats is used to parse the program.
It takes an output file from the program and finds averages and
minimums, along with total runtimes for multiple runs.  It takes
the number of runs and output file as parameters.  It can be
used with the Unix Shell runs.sh.  Any questions should be
directed to Chuck Alpert at cheese@cs.ucla.edu.

For example
runs.sh p1 20

produces the file Results/p1.res
